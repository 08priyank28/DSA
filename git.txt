    git commit -m "msg"
    git status
    git reomote add origin <url for repo> 
        git reomote add origin https://github.com/08priyank28/DSA

    git remote -v (to check remote)
    git branch (to check branch)
    git branch -M main (to rename branch)
    git push origin main


Git Branches

    git branch (to check branch)
    git branch -M main (to rename branch)
    git checkout <branch-name> (to navigate)
    git checkout -b <branch name> (to create new branch)
    git checkout -d <branch name> (to delete branch)

    Create feature branch and update your code into it and push it at the en to the origin
    git push origin feature1


Merging code
    Way 1
        git diff <branch name> (to compare commits, branches and more)
        git merge <branch-name> (to merge to branches)

    Way 2
        Create a PR        

        PR : It lets you tell others about changes you have pushed to a branch in a repo on github.

Pull Command

Undoing changes

    Case 1: staged changes
        git reset <file-name>
        git reset

    Case 2: commited changes (for one commit>
        git reset Head~1

    Case 3: commited changes (for many commits)
        git reset <commit-hash>
        git reset --hard <commit-hash>

Fork 
    A fork is a new repo that shares code and visibility settings with the original upstream repository.
    Fork is a rough copy.
